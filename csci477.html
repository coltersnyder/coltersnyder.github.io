			Summary of the Class
		</h1>

		<p align="center">
			This class covered the basics of Game Development and Game Design. It went into detail about the game design process and timeline. For our final project, we got into teams, made a Game Design Document and started the making that document into a living document with each of the iterations of our final game. We made an alpha, beta, and release candidate of our final project. This final project is shown below. In addition to this final project, many other projects were completed alongside the final project to teach us core concepts about game development and design. These will be showcased below.

			Premise

		<p align="center">
			You're a group of Boy Scouts camping in the woods. It seems like a normal camping trip, until they hear something weird. Your only chance of survival is to run.

			Development
		</h3>

		<p align="center">
			Scouts' Night Out was developed using GameMaker Studio (GML). I was responsible for programming many backend mechanics including the menu. In this regard, one of my teammates and I took part in pair programming to program many elements, both frontend and backend, and to debug the game. This teammate was responsible for the sounds, art, and front end elements of development. The other two teammates did not contribute at all to the overall codebase or assets.
